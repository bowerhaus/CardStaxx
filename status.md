**State Structure Updates (App.tsx):**
```typescript
interface ViewSettings {
  scale: number;
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

// New state variables needed:
const [focusMode, setFocusMode] = useState(false);
const [normalViewSettings, setNormalViewSettings] = useState<ViewSettings>({
  scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0
});
const [focusViewSettings, setFocusViewSettings] = useState<ViewSettings>({
  scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0
});
```

**Key Components to Modify:**

### Recent Update: Editable Stack Titles Implementation (September 14, 2025)

**Feature Implementation**:
- **Data Model Enhancement**: Extended `StackData` interface with optional `title?: string` field
- **UI Transformation**: Replaced verbose "Card X of Y" headers with clean editable titles and compact "X/Y" count format
- **Editing System Integration**: Leveraged existing `EditableTextOverlay` component for seamless stack title editing
- **State Management**: Added `editingStackId` state and `handleStackTitleEditStart`/`handleUpdateStack` functions
- **Component Chain Updates**: Updated prop flow through App ‚Üí Canvas ‚Üí Stack components
- **Demo Enhancement**: Added descriptive titles to all 5 demo stacks:
  - "Key Characters" (characters-stack)
  - "Central Themes" (themes-stack)
  - "Visual Storytelling" (visual-stack)
  - "Major Plot Points" (plot-stack)
  - "Literary Analysis" (literary-stack)

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `.cardstaxx` files without stack titles load seamlessly
- **Visual Design**: Left-aligned editable title with right-aligned compact card count
- **Interaction Model**: Double-click title to edit (consistent with card editing), shows "Untitled Stack" placeholder for empty titles
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the component chain

**Impact**: This enhancement significantly improves stack organization and user experience by providing clear, customizable labels for multi-card stacks while maintaining the compact visual design.

## Recent Update: Canvas Panning & Timeline Improvements (September 15, 2025)

### Canvas Panning Implementation:
- **Hand Cursor Interaction**: Added grab/grabbing cursor states when dragging empty canvas areas
- **Mouse Event Handling**: Implemented canvas panning via drag operations on empty space
- **State Management**: Added `isDraggingCanvas` state and mouse position tracking for smooth panning
- **Integration**: Canvas translation now properly integrated with existing zoom and focus mode systems

### Timeline Enhancement - Viewport-Fixed Positioning:
- **Independent Positioning**: Timeline now uses fixed viewport positioning, completely independent of canvas zoom/pan/translation
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Implemented proper coordinate transformation from canvas space to viewport space for connection lines
- **Connection Line Fixes**: Fixed double-offset issue where sidebar width was being added twice to connection coordinates
- **Y-Position Accuracy**: Timeline icon Y coordinates now correctly calculated relative to viewport bottom position
- **Visual Improvements**: Enhanced connection line weight (2px ‚Üí 3px) and dash pattern (5,5 ‚Üí 8,4) for better visibility
- **Font Consistency**: Applied consistent `FONT_FAMILY` typography across all timeline text elements

### Technical Implementation Details:
- **App.tsx**: Added `handleCanvasTranslationChange` callback for canvas translation state management
- **Canvas.tsx**: 
  - Added canvas drag state management (`isDraggingCanvas`, `lastCanvasMousePos`)
  - Implemented mouse handlers for panning (`handleStageMouseDown`, `handleStageMouseUp`, etc.)
  - Added grab/grabbing cursor management based on drag state
- **Timeline.tsx**: 
  - Converted from canvas-relative to viewport-fixed positioning (`position: 'fixed'`)
  - Fixed coordinate transformation function to avoid double sidebar offset
  - Updated connection line Y calculation to use viewport coordinates: `viewportHeight - TIMELINE_MARGIN - TIMELINE_HEIGHT / 2`
  - Enhanced visual styling with increased line weight and improved typography

### Impact: 
These improvements significantly enhance user experience by providing intuitive canvas navigation and ensuring the timeline remains accessible and properly connected regardless of canvas transformations. The timeline now truly functions as a persistent navigation aid that's always visible at the bottom of the screen.

## Recent Update: App.tsx Refactoring for Maintainability (September 15, 2025)

### Massive Codebase Refactoring Implementation:
- **Code Reduction**: Reduced App.tsx from 1,886 lines to 249 lines (87% reduction)
- **Modular Architecture**: Split monolithic component into focused, reusable modules
- **Custom Hooks Creation**: Extracted 8 custom hooks for state management:
  - `useWorkspace` - File operations and workspace management
  - `useEditingState` - Centralized editing state management
  - `useFocusMode` - Focus mode and view transformations  
  - `useSearch` - Search functionality and filtering logic
  - `useCardOperations` - Card CRUD operations and UI interactions
  - `useStackOperations` - Stack management and drag-and-drop
  - `useConnectionOperations` - Connection handling and editing
  - `useTimeline` - Timeline visibility and interactions

### Services Layer Implementation:
- **workspaceService.ts**: Data migration utilities and backward compatibility functions
- **demoDataService.ts**: Lord of the Rings movie analysis demo data generation

### Utilities Extraction:
- **positionCalculations.ts**: Card screen positioning and overlay calculations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from UI components

### Architecture Benefits:
- **Maintainability**: Each module has single responsibility and clear interface
- **Testability**: Hooks and services can be unit tested in isolation  
- **Reusability**: Custom hooks can be reused across components
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage maintained
- **Performance**: Better memoization opportunities with focused hooks

### Documentation Updates:
- **README.md**: Updated project structure section with new architecture
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated file organization and architectural concepts
- **Compilation**: All TypeScript errors resolved, app compiles and runs successfully

### Technical Implementation:
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved during refactoring
- **Import Fixes**: Updated all import statements to reference correct modules
- **Hook Composition**: App.tsx now orchestrates hooks instead of managing state directly
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces between hooks and components

### Impact: 
This refactoring significantly improves codebase maintainability, making it easier to add features, fix bugs, and onboard new developers. The modular architecture follows React best practices and enables better testing strategies.
