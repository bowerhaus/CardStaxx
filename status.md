## 📋 Implementation Dependencies

### **Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. **Phase 1** must complete before **Phase 2** (data model needed for enhanced features)
2. **Phase 2** must complete before **Phase 3** (card enhancements needed for stack visuals)
3. **Phase 4** depends on **Phase 1** completion (search needs new data fields)
4. **Phase 5** can run parallel with **Phases 2-4** (independent connection features)
5. **Phase 6** depends on **Phases 1-2** (timeline needs date fields and filtering)
6. **Phase 7** is final integration phase (depends on all previous phases)

### **Parallel Development Opportunities:**
- **Phase 5** (Connection Management) can be developed alongside **Phases 2-4**
- **Phase 4** (Search) and **Phase 3** (Stack Features) can be developed in parallel after **Phase 1**
- **UI/UX improvements** from **Phase 7** can be integrated throughout development
