Specification Document: Notecard Flow Application
Version: 1.0 Date: May 24, 2024

1.0 Overview
Notecard Flow is a dynamic, visual knowledge management tool designed to help users capture, organize, and connect ideas. Using a digital canvas, users can create and manipulate virtual notecards, group them into stacks, and draw relationships between them, creating a fluid and interconnected web of information. The system leverages spatial organization, color-coding, and a unique timeline feature to provide multiple dimensions for exploring the knowledge base.

2.0 Core Data Model
The application is built on two primary data entities: Notecards and Connections.
2.1 Notecard Entity
A Notecard is the fundamental unit of information. Each notecard has the following properties:

2.2 Connection Entity
A Connection represents a directed relationship between two stacks of notecards.


3.0 User Interface
The application interface consists of a fixed sidebar for controls and a dynamic main canvas for interaction.
3.1 Sidebar
The sidebar on the left serves as the application's control panel. It includes:
Card Creation: A button to open a form for creating a new notecard.
Connection Controls: Buttons to enter "Connect From" and "Connect To" modes for linking stacks.
Timeline Control: A "Create Timeline" button to toggle the visibility of the timeline view on the canvas.
Search & Filter:
A global text search field to filter cards by title or content.
A tag filter section that dynamically populates with all available tags. Users can select multiple tags to filter cards.
Canvas Zoom Control: A panel with buttons (+, -), a manual percentage input, and a reset button to control the zoom level of the main canvas. The scroll wheel also works when hovering over this panel.
Statistics: A display of the total number of notecards.
3.2 Canvas
The canvas is the main workspace where all visual elements are rendered and manipulated.
It displays all individual notecards and stacks at their specified positions.
It renders directed, named connection lines between stacks.
It provides the space for all drag-and-drop interactions.
When activated, it displays the Timeline feature at the bottom.

4.0 Feature Specifications
4.1 Card & Stack Manipulation
Card Creation: New cards are created via the sidebar form. They appear on the canvas at a random position with the date field pre-filled to the current day.
Real-Time Dragging: When a single card is dragged, its visual representation follows the cursor's movement precisely until it is dropped.
Stacking:
Creation: Dragging a card and dropping it onto another individual card creates a new stack.
Adding: Dropping a card onto an existing stack adds it to that group.
Stack Visualization (Rolodex view): Stacks are rendered with the top card fully visible and the headers of subsequent cards staggered behind it. A visual boundary box groups the elements.
Stack Interaction:
Scrolling: Using the mouse scroll wheel while hovering over a stack cycles through the cards, bringing the next or previous card to the front with a smooth animation.
Dragging: Entire stacks can be moved by dragging the boundary box or the top card.
4.2 Connecting Stacks
Users can enter a connection mode from the sidebar.
First, click a source stack ("Connect From").
Then, click a target stack ("Connect To").
A directed line is drawn between the centers of the two stacks.
Connections can be named and deleted by clicking on their name label.
4.3 Filtering and Data-Driven Views
Focus & Filter: When a user clicks to focus on a card that has a key, the system automatically filters all downstream connected stacks to show only cards that share the same key. This allows for powerful, context-sensitive data exploration.
Search & Tagging: Cards on the canvas and in the timeline are filtered in real-time based on the search term and selected tags.
4.4 Timeline Feature
Activation: Toggled by the "Create Timeline" button in the sidebar.
Display: A horizontal bar appears at the bottom of the canvas, spanning its width. It represents the date range of all currently filtered cards.
Card Representation:
Each card with a valid date is represented by an icon on the timeline, positioned chronologically.
If multiple cards share the same date, they are represented by a single group icon.
Interaction:
Hovering:
Hovering over a multi-card icon displays a tooltip listing all associated card titles.
Hovering over a card title in the list highlights both the card on the canvas and its connection line to the timeline.
Clicking: Clicking a timeline icon (or a title in a list) scrolls the corresponding card to the front of its stack (if applicable) and briefly highlights it with a yellow glow for visual feedback.
Visual Cues:
Connection Lines: A line is drawn from each timeline icon to its corresponding card on the canvas.
Weekly Markers: Subtle vertical dashes mark the start of each week (Monday) on the timeline for better temporal orientation.
