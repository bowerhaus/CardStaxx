This is the most important piece of information for me right now.\n\n2.  **Data Model:** Where should the application's data live?\n    *   **A) Local-first:** On the user's computer, stored in local files (e.g., Markdown files). This prioritizes privacy and offline use.\n    *   **B) Server-based:** In a cloud database, accessed via a web application. This enables access from any device and future collaboration.\n\n3.  **Key Features:** From the image, two features stand out. Could you elaborate on them?\n    *   **Timeline:** How should this work? Is it an automatic visualization of card dates, or something users build manually?\n    *   **Card Stacks:** How should users interact with a \"stack\" of cards?\n\nYour answers will help me define the project's scope, choose the right tools (for example, a web framework like React/Vue, a desktop wrapper like Electron, and a canvas library for the UI), and then write a comprehensive PRD.",

Using a digital canvas, users can create and manipulate virtual notecards, group them into stacks, and draw relationships between them, creating a fluid and interconnected web of information. The system leverages spatial organization, color-coding, and a unique timeline feature to provide multiple dimensions for exploring the knowledge base.\n\n2.0 Core Data Model\nThe application is built on two primary data entities: Notecards and Connections.\n2.1 Notecard Entity\nA Notecard is the fundamental unit of information. Each notecard has the following properties:\n\n2.2 Connection Entity\nA Connection represents a directed relationship between two stacks of notecards.\n\n\n3.0 User Interface\nThe application interface consists of a fixed sidebar for controls and a dynamic main canvas for interaction.\n3.1 Sidebar\nThe sidebar on the left serves as the application's control panel. It includes:\nCard Creation: A button to open a form for creating a new notecard.\nConnection Controls: Buttons to enter \"Connect From\" and \"Connect To\" modes for linking stacks.\nTimeline Control: A \"Create Timeline\" button to toggle the visibility of the timeline view on the canvas.\nSearch & Filter:\nA global text search field to filter cards by title or content.\nA tag filter section that dynamically populates with all available tags. Users can select multiple tags to filter cards.\nCanvas Zoom Control: A panel with buttons (+, -), a manual percentage input, and a reset button to control the zoom level of the main canvas. The scroll wheel also works when hovering over this panel.\nStatistics: A display of the total number of notecards.\n3.2 Canvas\nThe canvas is the main workspace where all visual elements are rendered and manipulated.\nIt displays all individual notecards and stacks at their specified positions.\nIt renders directed, named connection lines between stacks.\nIt provides the space for all drag-and-drop interactions.\nWhen activated, it displays the Timeline feature at the bottom.\n\n4.0 Feature Specifications\n4.1 Card & Stack Manipulation\nCard Creation: New cards are created via the sidebar form. They appear on the canvas at a random position with the date field pre-filled to the current day.\nReal-Time Dragging: When a single card is dragged, its visual representation follows the cursor's movement precisely until it is dropped.\nStacking:\nCreation: Dragging a card and dropping it onto another individual card creates a new stack.\nAdding: Dropping a card onto an existing stack adds it to that group.\nStack Visualization (Rolodex view): Stacks are rendered with the top card fully visible and the headers of subsequent cards staggered behind it. A visual boundary box groups the elements.\nStack Interaction:\nScrolling: Using the mouse scroll wheel while hovering over a stack cycles through the cards, bringing the next or previous card to the front with a smooth animation.\nDragging: Entire stacks can be moved by dragging the boundary box or the top card.\n4.2 Connecting Stacks\nUsers can enter a connection mode from the sidebar.\nFirst, click a source stack (\"Connect From\").\nThen, click a target stack (\"Connect To\").\nA directed line is drawn between the centers of the two stacks.\nConnections can be named and deleted by clicking on their name label.\n4.3 Filtering and Data-Driven Views\nFocus & Filter: When a user clicks to focus on a card that has a key, the system automatically filters all downstream connected stacks to show only cards that share the same key. This allows for powerful, context-sensitive data exploration.\nSearch & Tagging: Cards on the canvas and in the timeline are filtered in real-time based on the search term and selected tags.\n4.4 Timeline Feature\nActivation: Toggled by the \"Create Timeline\" button in the sidebar.\nDisplay: A horizontal bar appears at the bottom of the canvas, spanning its width. It represents the date range of all currently filtered cards.\nCard Representation:\nEach card with a valid date is represented by an icon on the timeline, positioned chronologically.\nIf multiple cards share the same date, they are represented by a single group icon.\nInteraction:\nHovering:\nHovering over a multi-card icon displays a tooltip listing all associated card titles.\nHovering over a card title in the list highlights both the card on the canvas and its connection line to the timeline.\nClicking: Clicking a timeline icon (or a title in a list) scrolls the corresponding card to the front of its stack (if applicable) and briefly highlights it with a yellow glow for visual feedback.\nVisual Cues:\nConnection Lines: A line is drawn from each timeline icon to its corresponding card on the canvas.\nWeekly Markers: Subtle vertical dashes mark the start of each week (Monday) on the timeline for better temporal orientation.\na minute ago\n--- End of content ---"

The specification document is very clear, and your answers confirm the core requirements.\n\nBased on this, I can now propose a technology stack and create the Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n\n### Proposed Technology Stack\n\n*   **Application Framework:** **Electron**. This will allow us to create a cross-platform desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux) using web technologies, which perfectly suits the \"local-first\" data storage requirement.\n*   **UI Library:** **React with TypeScript**. React is ideal for building the complex, component-based interface you've described. TypeScript will ensure the application is robust and easier to maintain by providing static typing for your data models (`Notecard`, `Connection`).\n*   **Canvas Library:** **Konva.js**. A dedicated canvas library is essential for the graphical and interactive nature of the main workspace. Konva, used with `react-konva`, provides high-level tools for drag-and-drop, scaling, event handling, and animations, which will significantly speed up development.\n*   **Data Format:** **JSON**. A single JSON file will be used to store the entire state of the knowledge base, including all notecards, their content, positions, and the connections between them. This is a simple and effective solution for a local-first application.\n\nI will now create the `PRD.md` file with the full specification.",

After that, I'll update `package.json`.Okay, I have the file contents.\n\nFirst, I will update `forge.config.js` to integrate the Webpack plugin.

Your task is to analyze the current directory and generate a comprehensive GEMINI.md file to be used as instructional context for future interactions.\n\n**Analysis Process:**\n\n1.  **Initial Exploration:**\n    *   Start by listing the files and directories to get a high-level overview of the structure.\n    *   Read the README file (e.g., `README.md`, `README.txt`) if it exists. This is often the best place to start.\n\n2.  **Iterative Deep Dive (up to 10 files):**\n    *   Based on your initial findings, select a few files that seem most important (e.g., configuration files, main source files, documentation).\n    *   Read them. As you learn more, refine your understanding and decide which files to read next. You don't need to decide all 10 files at once. Let your discoveries guide your exploration.\n\n3.  **Identify Project Type:**\n    *   **Code Project:** Look for clues like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.gradle`, or a `src` directory. If you find them, this is likely a software project.\n    *   **Non-Code Project:** If you don't find code-related files, this might be a directory for documentation, research papers, notes, or something else.\n\n**GEMINI.md Content Generation:**\n\n**For a Code Project:**\n\n*   **Project Overview:** Write a clear and concise summary of the project's purpose, main technologies, and architecture.\n*   **Building and Running:** Document the key commands for building, running, and testing the project. Infer these from the files you've read (e.g., `scripts` in `package.json`, `Makefile`, etc.). If you can't find explicit commands, provide a placeholder with a TODO.\n*   **Development Conventions:** Describe any coding styles, testing practices, or contribution guidelines you can infer from the codebase.\n\n**For a Non-Code Project:**\n\n*   **Directory Overview:** Describe the purpose and contents of the directory. What is it for? What kind of information does it hold?\n*   **Key Files:** List the most important files and briefly explain what they contain.\n*   **Usage:** Explain how the contents of this directory are intended to be used.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nWrite the complete content to the `GEMINI.md` file. The output must be well-formatted Markdown.\n"

Introduction\nCardStaxx is a dynamic, visual knowledge management tool designed to help users capture, organize, and connect ideas. It uses a spatial canvas to provide a fluid and interconnected way to manage information, moving beyond traditional linear note-taking.\n\n## 2. Goals and Objectives\n*   **Primary Goal:** To create a local-first desktop application for visual knowledge management.\n*   **Core Objectives:**\n    *   Provide an infinite canvas for users to spatially organize virtual notecards.\n    *   Enable the creation of \"stacks\" of cards and directed connections between them.\n    *   Offer powerful filtering and visualization tools, including a dynamic timeline.\n    *   Ensure data is stored locally on the user's machine for privacy and offline access.\n\n## 3. Proposed Technology Stack\n*   **Application Framework:** Electron\n*   **UI Library:** React with TypeScript\n*   **Canvas Library:** Konva.js (via `react-konva`)\n*   **Data Format:** Local JSON file for data persistence.\n\n## 4. Core Data Entities\n\n### 4.1. Notecard\nThe fundamental unit of information.\n*   `id`: Unique identifier.\n*   `title`: The title of the card.\n*   `content`: The body of the note (text, lists).\n*   `tags`: An array of string tags for filtering.\n*   `key`: An optional string for the \"Focus & Filter\" feature.\n*   `date`: The creation date of the card.\n*   `position`: X/Y coordinates on the canvas.\n*   `stackId`: The ID of the stack it belongs to (can be null).\n\n### 4.2. Connection\nA directed relationship between two stacks of notecards.\n*   `id`: Unique identifier.\n*   `sourceStackId`: The ID of the origin stack.\n*   `targetStackId`: The ID of the destination stack.\n*   `label`: An optional name for the connection.\n\n## 5. Feature Specifications\n\n### 5.1. Main Interface\n*   **Sidebar:** A fixed control panel on the left containing:\n    *   Buttons for Card Creation and Connection modes.\n    *   A toggle button for the Timeline view.\n    *   Global text search and a tag-based filtering section.\n    *   Canvas zoom controls.\n    *   A display for the total number of notecards.\n*   **Canvas:** The main interactive workspace where notecards, stacks, and connections are rendered and manipulated.\n\n### 5.2. Card & Stack Management\n*   **Card Creation:** New cards are created via the sidebar and appear on the canvas. The `date` field defaults to the current day.\n*   **Stacking:**\n    *   **Creation:** Dragging and dropping a card onto another card creates a new stack.\n    *   **Adding:** Dropping a card onto an existing stack adds it to that stack.\n*   **Stack Visualization (Rolodex View):** Stacks display the top card fully, with the headers of subsequent cards visible behind it.\n*   **Stack Interaction:**\n    *   The mouse scroll wheel cycles through cards in a stack.\n    *   Entire stacks can be moved by dragging them.\n\n### 5.3. Connections\n*   Users can create a named, directed line between two stacks using the \"Connect From\" and \"Connect To\" modes.\n\n### 5.4. Search & Filtering\n*   **Global Search/Filter:** The canvas view updates in real-time as the user types in the search bar or selects tags.\n*   **Focus & Filter:** When a user focuses on a card possessing a `key`, all downstream connected stacks are filtered to display only cards that share the same `key`.\n\n### 5.5. Timeline View\n*   **Activation:** Toggled by a button in the sidebar.\n*   **Display:** A horizontal bar at the bottom of the canvas showing the date range of *filtered* cards.\n*   **Interaction:**\n    *   Each card is represented by an icon on the timeline.\n    *   Hovering over an icon (or group of icons) shows a tooltip with card titles and highlights the card on the canvas.\n    *   Clicking an icon scrolls the card to the front of its stack and highlights it.\n    *   A visual line connects the timeline icon to its corresponding card on the canvas.\n\n### 5.6. Data Persistence (MVP)\n*   The application will be **local-first**.\n*   For the initial MVP, the entire state of the knowledge base (all notecards, connections, positions, etc.) will be saved to a single JSON file. This approach prioritizes simplicity for the first version.\n\n## 6. Future Considerations\n*   **Database Scalability:** For improved performance and scalability, the JSON file storage will be replaced with a more efficient embedded database solution (e.g., SQLite) in a future version.\n*   **Cloud Sync/Web App:** The architecture should allow for a future transition to a client-server model to enable web access and cloud synchronization.\n\n## 7. Out of Scope (v1.0)\n*   Real-time multi-user collaboration.\n*   Mobile/tablet applications.\n*   Advanced data import/export from other formats.\n*   Version history for notecards.\n\n\n--- /Users/andybower/Documents/Projects/CardStaxx/electron/main.ts ---\n\nimport { app, BrowserWindow } from 'electron';\nimport * as path from 'path';\n\n// This is a global variable provided by the Webpack plugin.\ndeclare const MAIN_WINDOW_WEBPACK_ENTRY: string;\n\nfunction createWindow() {\n  const win = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 1200,\n    height: 800,\n    webPreferences: {\n      nodeIntegration: true,\n      contextIsolation: false,\n    },\n  });\n\n  // and load the index.html of the app.\n  win.loadURL(MAIN_WINDOW_WEBPACK_ENTRY);\n\n  // Open the DevTools.\n  win.webContents.openDevTools();\n}\n\napp.whenReady().then(createWindow);\n\napp.on('window-all-closed', () => {\n  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {\n    app.quit();\n  }\n});\n\napp.on('activate', () => {\n  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {\n    createWindow();\n  }\n});\n\n\n--- /Users/andybower/Documents/Projects/CardStaxx/forge.config.js ---\n\nconst { FusesPlugin } = require('@electron-forge/plugin-fuses');\nconst { FuseV1Options, FuseVersion } = require('@electron/fuses');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  packagerConfig: {\n    asar: true,\n  },\n  rebuildConfig: {},\n  makers: [\n    {\n      name: '@electron-forge/maker-squirrel',\n      config: {},\n    },\n    {\n      name: '@electron-forge/maker-zip',\n      platforms: ['darwin'],\n    },\n    {\n      name: '@electron-forge/maker-deb',\n      config: {},\n    },\n    {\n      name: '@electron-forge/maker-rpm',\n      config: {},\n    },\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      name: '@electron-forge/plugin-webpack',\n      config: {\n        mainConfig: './webpack.main.config.js',\n        renderer: {\n          config: './webpack.renderer.config.js',\n          entryPoints: [\n            {\n              html: './public/index.html',\n              js: './src/index.tsx',\n              name: 'main_window',\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    new FusesPlugin({\n      version: FuseVersion.V1,\n      [FuseV1Options.RunAsNode]: false,\n      [FuseV1Options.EnableCookieEncryption]: true,\n      [FuseV1Options.EnableNodeOptionsEnvironmentVariable]: false,\n      [FuseV1Options.EnableNodeCliInspectArguments]: false,\n      [FuseV1Options.EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation]: true,\n      [FuseV1Options.OnlyLoadAppFromAsar]: true,\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n\n\n--- /Users/andybower/Documents/Projects/CardStaxx/package.json ---\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"cardstaxx\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \".webpack/main\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\",\n    \"start\": \"electron-forge start\",\n    \"package\": \"electron-forge package\",\n    \"make\": \"electron-forge make\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"type\": \"commonjs\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"electron-squirrel-startup\": \"^1.0.1\",\n    \"konva\": \"^10.0.1\",\n    \"react\": \"^19.1.1\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.1.1\",\n    \"react-konva\": \"^19.0.10\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@electron-forge/cli\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron-forge/maker-deb\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron-forge/maker-rpm\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron-forge/maker-squirrel\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron-forge/maker-zip\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron-forge/plugin-auto-unpack-natives\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron-forge/plugin-fuses\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron-forge/plugin-webpack\": \"^7.9.0\",\n    \"@electron/fuses\": \"^1.8.0\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^19.1.12\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^19.1.9\",\n    \"@vercel/webpack-asset-relocator-loader\": \"^1.10.0\",\n    \"css-loader\": \"^7.1.2\",\n    \"electron\": \"^38.0.0\",\n    \"fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin\": \"^9.1.0\",\n    \"node-loader\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"style-loader\": \"^4.0.0\",\n    \"ts-loader\": \"^9.5.4\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.9.2\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n--- End of content ---"
